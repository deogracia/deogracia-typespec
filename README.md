# deogracia-typespec README

Add color to your TypeSpec file.
I only did this because:

* the (original one)[] is not yet ported on open-vsx;
* I wanted to know if I'm capable of doing it;

## Features

For now:
* it colors your TypeSpec code;

Later, I hope I can add:
* semantic;
* some snippets;
* maybe some language server support;

## Requirements

* vscodium > 1.108.1

## Known Issues

* None for now and a longer time after (I hope).

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release
* Add coloration of your code.
